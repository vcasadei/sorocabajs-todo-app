# SorocabaJS Todo app

This code was based on the tutorial produced by Chris Sevilleja on [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular "Creating a Single Page Todo App with Node and Angular").

The code has been modified and improved in order to present new functionalities that would be useful for a coding dojo activity at the [II SorocabaJS](http://sorocabajs.github.io/ "II SorocabaJS") that happened on Sorocaba (SP) Brazil in 14th of November, 2015.

This is an example code of an application that uses MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS and NodeJS (MEAN stack) and should not be used in production by any means.
